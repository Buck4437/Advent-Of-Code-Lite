                    <p>You have been challenged to a game of <span title="Definitely not Fruit Box.">Fruit List</span>! Before playing the game, you need to examine your list of fruits (your puzzle input) and check your odds of winning.</p>
                    <p>On the list, each fruit is represented by a value between <code>1</code> and <code>9</code>.</p>
                    <p>To calculate the winning potential of the list, <em>add up all the values in the list</em>.</p>
                    <p>For example, consider the following list:</p>
                    <pre><code>1
4
2
3
3
7
9
7
5
3
1</code></pre>
                    <p>The winning potential of this list is <code><em>45</em></code>.</p>
                    <p><em>What is the winning potential of your fruit list?</em></p>
                </template>
                <template #part2>
                    <p>You are now ready for fruit list.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of fruit list, you start with a fruit sum of <code>0</code>. On each turn, the player moves down the list, and the value is added to your fruit sum.</p>
                    <p>When your fruit sum is a multiplier of <code>10</code>, <em>an elimination occurs</em>, and your fruit sum is divided by <code>10</code>. Elimination will <em>only happen once per turn</em>. If your fruit sum is 100, it will become 10, and will not be further divided to 1.</p>
                    <p>Your final score is obtained by <em>multiplying the number of elimination and your final fruit sum together</em>.</p>
                    <p>Consider the example above:</p>
                    <pre><code>Turn 1:
Sum = 1 <em>(+1)</em>, Elimination = 0

Turn 2:
Sum = 5 <em>(+4)</em>, Elimination = 0

Turn 3:
Sum = 7 <em>(+2)</em>, Elimination = 0

Turn 4:
Sum = 10 <em>(+3)</em>, Elimination = 0

Because the sum is a multiple of 10, an elimination occurs:
Sum = 1, Elimination = 1 <em>(+1)</em>

Turn 5:
Sum = 4 <em>(+3)</em>, Elimination = 1

...

Turn 11:
Sum = 18 <em>(+1)</em>, Elimination = 2</code></pre>
                    <p>Therefore, the final score is <code>18 * 2 = <em>36</em></code>.</p>
                    <p><em>What is the final score of your fruit list?</em></p>

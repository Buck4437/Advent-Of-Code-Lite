                    <p>After fixing your roomba, you have decided to lie on the sofa and play some video games. However, the game crashed upon opening, and an error was displayed:</p>
                    <code>Unable to open game. Reason: Invalid save data</code>
                    <p>It seems that <em>some of your save data are corrupted!</em> To identify the issue, you extracted you save data and compiled it into a list (your puzzle input)</p>
                    <p>The save data is stored in the form of binary numbers. All binary numbers are eight-digit long, and extra <code>0</code>s are padding at the beginning if the number is less than eight-digit long.</p>
                    <p>After scanning your save data, you noticed that some numbers started with a <code>1</code>. These numbers represent negative values, and should not be present in the save data! This means <em>all numbers that start with a <code>1</code> are corrupted,</em> and they should be discarded.</p>
                    <p>For example, consider these numbers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>00001000</code>, <code>00101100</code> and <code>01111111</code> are valid numbers as they start with a <code>0</code>. These numbers are not corrupted.</li>
                        <li><code>11010100</code>, <code>10110101</code> and <code>10000000</code> are invalid numbers as they start with a <code>1</code>. These numbers are corrupted and should be discarded.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><em>After discarding all corrupted numbers, how many numbers still remain in your save data?</em></p>
                </template>
                <template #part2>
                    <p>After discarding all the corrupted numbers, it's time to recompute the <em>checksum of your save data.</em></p>
                    <p>The checksum is obtained by the following steps:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All corrupted numbers are discarded and will not involve in the calculation of the checksum.</li>
                        <li>All binary numbers are <em>translated into decimal numbers.</em> For example, <code>00000001</code> is translated to <code>1</code>, and <code>01101110</code> is translated to <code>110</code>.</li>
                        <li>The checksum is obtained by <em>adding up all the decimal numbers.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For example, consider the following save file:</p>
<pre><code>10011100
01100101
11011001
00111011
00100111
01110111
01111000

Discard all corrupted numbers:
01100101
00111011
00100111
01110111
01111000

Translate numbers to decimal:
101
59
39
119
120</code></pre>
                    <p>The checksum is <code>101+59+39+119+120=<em>438</em></code>.</p>
                    <p><em>What is the checksum of your save data?</em></p>

                    <p>After fixing your save file, you are ready to play the video game - Maze Master.</p>
                    <p>However, your cat has decided to join the fun and started spamming random buttons on your controller, making you get lost in the maze very soon after.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, the game records <em>your past moves</em> and display them on the side bar (your puzzle input), <em>ordered from oldest to newest</em>, which you can use to work out your position.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning, you are located at the entrance of the maze.</p>
                    <p>There are <em>two basic moves</em> in this game: <code>></code> and <code><</code>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>></code> moves you towards the right by <code>1</code> space.</li>
                        <li><code><</code> moves you towards the left by <code>1</code> space.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are also <em>two advanced moves</em> in this game: <code>>></code> and <code><<</code>. You still haven't worked out what they do, but it seems that they work as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>>></code> moves you towards the right by <em><code>5</code></em> spaces.</li>
                        <li><code><<</code> moves you towards the left by <em><code>5</code></em> spaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To figure out your location, you need to <em>calculate the distance from the entrance by simulating the moves.</em></p>
                    <p>Consider the following example, taking right as positive:</p>
<pre><code>      | Current position
start | 0
>     | 1
<<    | -4
<     | -5
>>    | 0
>     | 1
<     | 0
<<    | -5
<<    | -10
>     | -9
>>    | -4
<     | -5</code></pre>
                    <p>The distance from the entrance is <code>5</code>, taking the absolute value.</p>
                    <p>After executing your moves, <em>what is your distance from the entrance?</em></p>
                </template>
                <template #part2>
                    <p>After figuring out your position, you head back to the entrance... or so you thought. Strangely, the entrance isn't there when you reach it.</p>

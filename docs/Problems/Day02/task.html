                    <p>While you are organizing your <a class="link" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1">star coin</a> collections, you accidentally spilt all of your coins, including some <em>fake chocolate coins</em>!</p>
                    <p>The chocolate coins look identical to the star coins, so there's no easy way to tell them apart. Fortunately, each coin is labeled with a unique ID, so you can use them to identify fake coins and separate them from your real star coins.</p>
                    <p>After picking up all the coins, you made a list of coin IDs (your puzzle input). You faintly remembered that <em>the ID of star coins must not end with <code>0</code></em>. That means that all coins whose ID ends with <code>0</code> must be a fake chocolate coin.</p>
                    <p>For example, consider the following list:</p>
                    <pre><code>312
911
508
707
100</code></pre>
                    <p>The first four coin IDs do not end with a <code>0</code>, so those are valid star coin IDs. The final coin ID (<code>100</code>) ends with a <code>0</code>, so it is not a valid coin ID, and thus is a fake chocolate coin.</p>
                    <p>To calculate the <em>total value</em> of star coins, <em>exclude all invalid coin IDs and sum up all valid coin IDs</em>. In the example above, the total value of star coins is <code><em>2438</em></code>.</p>
                    <p>What is the <em>total value of star coins in your list</em>?</p>
                </template>
                <template #part2>
                    <p>You seemed to have more coins than you remembered; looks like you still haven't separated all the chocolate coins from the pile.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, you remembered what the actual rule was: <em>the ID of star coins must not contain <code>0</code> in any of the digits.</em> That is to say, all digits of valid star coin IDs must be between <code>1</code> and <code>9</code>, and consequently all invalid coin IDs contain at least one <code>0</code> in its digits.</p>
                    <p>Consider the example above: <code>508</code> and <code>707</code> are no longer valid coin IDs as they contain a <code>0</code> in their second digit.</p>
                    <p>After updating the rules, the total value of star IDs of the list above is <code><em>1223</em></code>.</p>
                    <p>Apply the new rules to your list. What is the <em>new total value of star coins in your list?</em></p>
